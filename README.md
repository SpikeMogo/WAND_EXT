## Disclaimer

This is a free, open-source project built purely for learning and experimentation. Just like WAND 1.0 and WAND 2.0, the author has never profited from this project and will never use WAND_EXT as a commercial product. It is not monetized, not sold, and not commercially distributed. If you paid for this, you were scammed.

**Use at your own risk.** See the full [disclaimer](https://spikemogo.github.io/WAND_EXT/#disclaimer) for details.
